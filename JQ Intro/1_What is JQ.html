<!-- What is jQuery?

jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.

The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.

jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.

jQuery also simplifies a lot of complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.

The jQuery library contains the following features:

	HTML/DOM manipulation
	CSS manipulation
	HTML event methods
	Effects and animations
	AJAX
	Utilities
	Tip: In addition, jQuery has plugins for almost any task out there.

Why jQuery?
There are lots of other JavaScript frameworks out there, but jQuery seems to be the most popular, and also the most extendable.

There are several ways to start using jQuery on your web site. You can:

1.Download the jQuery library from jQuery.com
2.Include jQuery from a CDN, like Google

The jQuery library is a single JavaScript file, and you reference it with the HTML <script> tag (notice that the <script> tag should be inside the <head> section):

<head>
<script src="jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
</head> 


We do not have type="text/javascript" inside the <script> tag becuse,this is not required in HTML5. JavaScript is the default scripting language in HTML5 and in all modern browsers.


jQuery CDN : 
If you don't want to download and host jQuery yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

Both Google and Microsoft host jQuery.

To use jQuery from Google or Microsoft, use one of the following:

Google CDN:
	<head>
	<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
	</head>

Microsoft CDN:
	<head>
	<script src="https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
	</head>
