With jQuery you select (query) HTML elements and perform "actions" on them.

Basic syntax is: 
	$(selector).action()

A $ sign to define/access jQuery
A (selector) to "query (or find)" HTML elements
A jQuery action() to be performed on the element(s)
Examples:

$(this).hide() - hides the current element.

$("p").hide() - hides all <p> elements.

$(".test").hide() - hides all elements with class="test".

$("#test").hide() - hides the element with id="test".



The Document Ready Event
All jQuery methods in our examples, are inside a document ready event:

$(document).ready(function(){

   // jQuery methods go here...

});

This is to prevent any jQuery code from running before the document is finished loading (is ready).

It is good practice to wait for the document to be fully loaded and ready before working with it. This also allows you to have your JavaScript code before the body of your document, in the head section.


Tip: The jQuery team has also created an even shorter method for the document ready event:

$(function(){

   // jQuery methods go here...

});
